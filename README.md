# biometrics_PCA_LDA
Implementation of face recognition algorithm based on principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The algorithms were implemented in Matlab.

****project created for the requirement of the course of Biometrics by Syed Aqeel Awais***

Both the programs can be created by just supplying the training and testing input images
The database that has been used is ORL face databases can be accessed 
"http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/dengcai/Data/FaceData.html".

The dataset has 400 images 
and just 2 images from every set of 10 images has been used for training data, the
rest 320 images are used as testing. The program can be compiled by providing datasets and
only top 10 values of eigen and fisher has been considered against the highest eigen 
obtained eigen values.
